      <p class="description"> Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official.
      </p>

      <p class="description"> Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
      </p>

      <p class="description">National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.
